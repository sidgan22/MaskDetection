# Mask Detection using MobileNetV2/NASNetMobile


# NASNET
Two NASNet-A checkpoints are available that have been trained on the
[ILSVRC-2012-CLS](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/)
image classification dataset. Accuracies were computed by evaluating using a single image crop.

Model Checkpoint | Million MACs | Million Parameters | Top-1 Accuracy| Top-5 Accuracy |
